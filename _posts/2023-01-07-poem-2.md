I had written this poem after the massive earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, about eight years ago. The poem talks about the panic and chaos of people during the earthquake. Thanks to Ambika Gautam for providing me with an opportunity to post the video on her youtube channel. The video was shot two years ago by Mr Yugesh K C. Huge thanks to my friend Yugesh.
